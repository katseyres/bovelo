## Presentation :information_source:

We created this application to provide some organization to startups (more precisely a bicycle startup).  

It contains a GUI that displays their products and eventually records orders. The backend of the application can also organize a schedule to manage the different orders.  

The whole data management uses MySql's database and its setup is already done.

## Requirements

Now it's time to try this app. You have to clone the repository in a local folder on your computer. Then create a new file named `Database.cs` and copy the bellow lines of code to paste it.

And now enjoy the app !
